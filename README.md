# 🏠 Sakany App

**Sakany** is a mobile app built as my graduation project 🎓. It helps students, employees, and anyone searching for housing find apartments easily — while also allowing landlords and brokers to list their properties quickly.

Finding housing usually depends on connections and word of mouth. Sakany changes that by creating a reliable, centralized platform to make the process easier, faster, and smarter.
